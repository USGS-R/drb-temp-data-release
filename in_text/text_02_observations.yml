  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 2 water temperature and flow observations

abstract: >-
  Observed water temperatures from 1980-2019 were compiled for the Delaware River Basin, US. These data were used
  as XX. The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) file with attributes corresponding to the unique combination of
  lake identifier, time, and depth. Data came from a variety of sources, including the National Water Inventory System, 
  Water Quality Portal, and the NorEaST stream water temperature database.
