  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 2 Water temperature and flow observations

abstract: >-
  Observed water temperatures from 1980-2019 were compiled for the Delaware River Basin, US. These data were used
  as XX. The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) file with attributes corresponding to the unique combination of
  lake identifier, time, and depth. Data came from a variety of sources, including the National Water Inventory System, 
  Water Quality Portal, and the NorEaST stream water temperature database.
  
  Flow observation data
  
  Daily reservoir releases from the Pepacton, Neversink, and Cannonsville reservoirs
  
  Daily water temperature observations for inflow and outflow reaches of the Pepacton and Cannonsville reservoirs
  
  Daily water temperature and water level observations for the Pepacton and Cannonsville reservoirs
