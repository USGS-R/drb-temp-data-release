  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 2 Water temperature and flow observations

abstract: >-
  Observations related to water and thermal budgets in the Delaware River Basin. Data from reservoirs in the basin include
  reservoir characteristics (e.g., bathymetry), daily water levels, daily depth-resolved water temperature observations, 
  and daily inflows, diversions, and releases. Data from streams in the basin include daily flow and temperature observations.  
  Data were compiled from a variety of sources to cover the modeling period (1980-2021), including the National Water Inventory System, 
  Water Quality Portal, EcoSHEDS stream water temperature database, ReaLSAT, and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) or zipped csv.

    data-description: >- 
      Daily water temperature observations with sites matched to 456 model river segments in the Delaware River Basin.
      Files represent various subsets of similar data, and are either from all 456 segments (temperature_observations.zip), a subset of XX segments above the
      Delaware River at Lordville, NY (temperature_observations_lordville.zip), or at the 5 priority forecast sites.
      Water temperature observations were compiled from NWIS, EcoSHEDS, and WQP. If multiple sites were matched to a single
      river reach and had measurements on the same day, the values were averaged.
   
      Temperature observations for five priority forecasting sites in the Delaware River Basin
      were first pulled from NWIS, and remaining data gaps in the modeling period
      were filled if there was data available from other sources (WQP or EcoSHEDS).
