      attr-label: subseg_id
      attr-def: >-
        An alternative unique reach identifier which was created in order to split segments such that 
        segment start and endpoints were connected by one reach with no intersecting reaches. The ID was created
        using the seg_id from the Geospatial Fabric and an index from one to the number of splits (e.g., {subseg_id}_{index}).
