  Data release: Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin


abstract: >-
  <p>Daily temperature predictions in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) can inform decision makers who can use cold-water reservoir releases to maintain thermal habitat for sensitive fish and mussel species.
  This data release provides the inputs and outputs for process-guided machine learning methods to improve prediction of water temperature across 456 river reaches in the DRB.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX">River Information</a> - A river reach metadata file and one shapefile of polylines for each 456 river segments in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX">Observations</a> - Water temperature observations for XX of the 456 river reaches used in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX">Model Configurations</a> - Model parameters and metadata used to configure models</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX">Model Inputs</a> - Data used to drive predictive models (distance matrices, river reach metadata, daily meteorology)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX">Model Predictions</a> - Predictions of water temperature</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/XX">Model Evaluation</a> - Performance of models</li>

  <p>This research was funded by the USGS, XX.</p>

build-environment: Multiple computer systems were used to generate these data, including linux, OSX. The open source languages R and Python were used on all systems. XX
