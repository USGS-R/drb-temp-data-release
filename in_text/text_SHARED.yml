  Daily temperature predictions in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) can inform decision makers who can use cold-water reservoir releases to maintain thermal habitat for sensitive fish and mussel species.
  This data release provides the inputs and outputs for process-guided machine learning methods to improve prediction of water temperature across 456 river reaches in the DRB.

build-environment: Multiple computer systems were used to generate these data, including linux, OSX. The open source languages R and Python were used on all systems.

process-description: >-
  At the core of the modeling framework is a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen process-based stream model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version 5.1.0 RC. PRMS is a 
  deterministic model that simulates watershed hydrology as a function of climate and land use, and the coupled SNTemp module simulates the change in stream temperature as a function of 
  changes in hydrology and energy. For reservoir modeling, our chosen model is the open source, General Lake Model (GLM) version 3.1. GLM is a one-dimensional dynamical model which simplifies lakes using a vertical approximation,
  where horizontal variability is ignored. GLM uses a Lagrangian approach to layer structure where layers can split and combine based on changing vertical gradients.
  GLM is a modern, implementation of other one-dimensional models. We used GLM to run individual lake simulations according to the processes described in Winslow et al. 2017.
