  Daily temperature predictions in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) can inform decision makers who can use cold-water reservoir releases to maintain thermal habitat for sensitive fish and mussel species.
  This data release provides the inputs and outputs for process-guided machine learning methods to improve prediction of water temperature across 456 river reaches in the DRB.

  At the core of the modeling framework is a coupled hydrologic-thermodynamic model that uses inputs of reach-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate flow and water temperature.
  Our chosen model is the open source, Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) with the coupled Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTemp) version XX. PRMS-SNTemp is a ...XX.
  We used PRMS-SNTemp to simulate stream flow and temperature for the period of record...XX.
