  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  PRMS-SNTemp was used to predict daily temperatures at 456 stream reaches in the Delaware River Basin. Daily stream temperature predictions for inflow and outflow reaches for Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs were pulled aside into a separate feather file.
  
  Reservoir outflow predictions and in-reservoir temperature predictions were generated with calibrated models built using the General Lake Model v3.1.
