  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 5 model prediction data

abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 456 stream reaches in the Delaware River Basin. Uncalibrated process-based models (PB0)
  used default configurations (see XX for details) and no parameters were adjusted according to model fit with observations. Deep Learning (DL) models were xx.
