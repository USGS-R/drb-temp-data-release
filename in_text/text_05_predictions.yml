  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  PRMS-SNTemp was used to predict daily temperatures at 456 stream reaches in the Delaware River Basin. Daily stream temperature predictions for inflow and outflow reaches for Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs were pulled aside into a separate feather file.
  
  Reservoir outflow predictions and in-reservoir temperature predictions were generated with calibrated models built using the General Lake Model v3.1.

    data-name: dwallin_stream_preds.csv
    data-description: Stream temperature predictions from the distance-weighted-average lotic-lentic input network (DWALLIN). Predictions were generated from a combination of lotic (from PRMS-SNTemp) and lentic (GLM) models. We assumed that just below the reservoirs, stream temperature would be driven by lentic processes, and therefore GLM outflow temperature predictions received a weight of 1 and SNTemp predictions received a weight of 0. We also assumed that the reservoir weight would exponentially decay with distance, and an exponential decay function was fit to calculated observed weights when stream temperature observations, SNTemp predictions, and GLM predictions were available below Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs. The estimated decay rates were 0.0358 and 0.0403 for Cannonsville and Pepacton, respectively. Predicted weights were then used to calculate stream temperature as temperature = res_weight*GLM_prediction + (1-res_weight)*SNTemp prediction for each stream segment in the network. For segments that weren't impacted by releases from Cannonsville or Pepacton, SNTemp predictions were used.
