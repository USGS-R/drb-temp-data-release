  Predicting water temperature in the Delaware River Basin: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 456 stream reaches in the Delaware River Basin. Uncalibrated process-based models (PB0)
  used default configurations (see XX for details) and no parameters were adjusted according to model fit with observations. Deep Learning (DL) models were xx.

  Daily stream temperature predictions for inflow and outflow reaches for Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs were pulled aside into a separate feather file.
