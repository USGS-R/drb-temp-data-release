    data-description: A matrix documentation the upstream (negative numbers) or downstream (positive numbers) distances between river reaches.
    attributes:
    -
      attr-label: from
      attr-def: >-
        The segment ID (seg_id_nat) of the starting segment for the distance calculation.

    -
      attr-label: {seg_id_nat}
      attr-def: >-
        Distance (in meters) between the seg_id_nat in the from column to the {seg_id_nat} in the column name. Positive numbers indicate a downstream direction, while positive numbers indicate an upstream direction.
