      A csv file for each reservoir with input meteorological data. Files are named "NLDAS_time[0.367700]_x{x}_y{y}.csv" where the x and y locations are longitude and latitude indices from NLDAS
      of the individual meteorological data cell (data are from Mitchell et al. 2004).
      The filename of the NLDAS file associated with each reservoir is listed in the "meteo_fl" fields in reservoir_nml_values.json, which is in the 3_config child item.

      NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System v12.0 0.25-degree operational model output for the 00 UTC forecast cycle from 2021-04-15 to 2021-07-16.
      These data are aggregated to the daily scale and NOAA GEFS grid cells are matched to the centroid of the target stream segment. The target stream segment
      seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.
